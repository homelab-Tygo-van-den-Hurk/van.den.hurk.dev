# [`van.den.hurk.dev`](https://van.den.hurk.dev/)
This is another very basic Apache HTTPD server that functions as a sort of sign mentioning any subdomain of `van.den.hurk.dev` are up for rent as I only want and need [`tygo.van.den.hurk.dev`](https://tygo.van.den.hurk.dev/). Chances anyone wants it are small but it's something, it was also really easy to make, so no losses there.
